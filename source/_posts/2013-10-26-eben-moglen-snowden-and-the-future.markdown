Eben Moglen has been promoting the issue of personal privacy in a world of
cloud services for several years now. The <a
href="http://www.freedomboxfoundation.org"> Freedom Box project</a> that he
started is an excellent approach to the issue.

In the aftermath of the Snowden revalations, he's delivering a series of
lectures on the topic entitled "<a
href="http://www.snowdenandthefuture.info">Snowden and the Future</a>". I can't
really suggest a beter source for clear commentary on this issue.

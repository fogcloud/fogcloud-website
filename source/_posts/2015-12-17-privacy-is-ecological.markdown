Eben Moglen says "Privacy is Ecological". Bruce Schneier says "non-broken security is good civic hygene".

These are important, related concepts. A society with widespread privacy and security is a qualitatively
different society than one where snooping is common and normalized.

Here's a good example of that:

Note how it doesn't matter who's collecting the data, and the broad negative effect isn't simply to 
individuals who "made the personal choice to give up their privacy".
